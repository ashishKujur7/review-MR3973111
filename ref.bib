 abstract = {In the first three sections the question of when a pure state $g$ on a $C^\ast$-subalgebra $B$ of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ has a unique state extension is studied. It is shown that an extension $f$ is unique if and only if $\|\inf\|b(a - f(a)1)b\| = 0$ for each $a$ in $A$, where the $\inf$ is taken over those $b$ in $B$ such that $0 \leqslant b \leqslant 1$ and $g(b) = 1$. The special cases where $B$ is maximal abelian and/or $A = B(H)$ are treated in more detail. In the remaining sections states of the form $T \mapsto \lim_{\mathscr{u}}(Tx_\alpha, x_\alpha)$, where $\{x_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \kappa}$ is a set of unit vectors in $H$ and $\mathscr{U}$ is an ultrafilter are studied.},
